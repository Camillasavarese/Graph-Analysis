# Graph-Analysis
Implementation of a graph analysis writing all algorithms from scratch. 

The steps of the analysis are:
    Building the graphs
    Overall informations of a graph
    Centrality measures (Beetweenness, Degree Centrality, Closeness, Page Rank)
    Shortest paths (Djikstra)
    Cutting a graph (BFS, DFS, Ford-Fulkersson)
